## How do I use Thoth?
Depending on your use case, you can interact with Thoth through a variety of integration points.

#### Thamos CLI
[Thamos](https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos) is a command line tool and [library](https://pypi.org/project/thamos/) for communicating with the Thoth backend. More information on how to
install and get started with it can be found in our [tutorial](https://redhat-scholars.github.io/managing-vulnerabilities-with-thoth/) space.

#### Kebechet
Kebechet is an extensible system of repository managers for GitHub, GitLab, and Pagure. You can use this bot integrate
the functionality of Thoth into your repositories. More information on Kebechet can be found [here](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/index.html).

#### Jupyterlab Extension
If you use Jupyterlab for development, this [extension](https://github.com/thoth-station/jupyterlab-requirements) allows
you to integrate Thoth's adviser into your notebook's environment.

#### Thoth User API

## What are Kebechet managers and how do I configure them?
Managers can be seen as separate bots all part of Kebechet. You can enable and configure each available bot by adding it
to your `.thoth.yaml` file in your repository. More information on what bots are available can be found [here](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/managers.html#available-managers).

---

## How do I configure my `.thoth.yaml` file?
Thoth's configuration file gets placed in the root of your repository (named as `.thoth.yaml`). This gets used by Thamos CLI and Thoth's bots.
The full set of options to configure your `.thoth.yaml` file are outlined and commented [here](https://thoth-station.ninja/help/support/configure/thoth_yaml.mdx).

## How do I configure the Thoth Advise Manager?
Detailed information on how to configure this manager can be found in the
[thoth-station/thamos](https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos) repository.

### Configuring the `runtime_environment`
Setting the `runtime_environment` tells Thoth Advisor which operating system and Python version should be used when
resolving your dependencies.

To list available environments for which the resolver can resolve dependencies, run the Thamos CLI command:

```
thamos environments
```

or use the Available Environments Tool:
