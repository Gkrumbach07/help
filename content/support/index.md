# Getting Support

**Channels of support**

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thoth-station/support/issues/new/choose)
- [Thoth Developer Google Chat Room](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAVjnVXFk)
- [FAQ](https://thoth-station.ninja/help/support/faq/overview.mdx)

## GitHub Issues

The primary channel for getting support is by creating a GitHub issue through our [support repository](https://github.com/thoth-station/support/issues/new/choose).
Choose between any of the issue templates or create a [blank issue](https://github.com/thoth-station/support/issues/new) if no template fits your situation.
Once created, your issue will be delegated out to one of Thoth's [Special Interest Groups (SIG)](https://thoth-station.ninja/help/community/core/community/governance.md)
or a specific person on the Thoth team. They will help you get the issue ready to be worked on by refining the issue to
meet our standards for a [_good quality issue_](https://thoth-station.ninja/help/community#quality).
Then your issue will be planned and worked on depending on its urgency.
